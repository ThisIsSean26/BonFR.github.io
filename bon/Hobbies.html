        <h5>Playing Sports & Watching Anime</h5>
        <p>I really love sports just like basketball the reason of that is basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to have fun with friends and possibly make some new ones. Basketball in my opinion the best thing i can do with my friends to have fun while burning few calories. The thing i love about watching anime is it's NOT just pure entertainment, it's also inspirational. It makes you want to do something in your life. Watching Anime is my stress reliever. </p>
